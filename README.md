This repository contains the code and notes i am using/used to learn NLP(Natural Language Processing).
Mainly it contains the basic spacy code syntax used for tokenization, Stemming and Lemmatization and different types of functions that can be used and this repository is created by following NLP playlist of the Codebasic channel.

Text Preprocessing and cleanup:

Basic Syntax - [Spacy_basics](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/NLP-practise/blob/main/Spacy_Basic_Tutorial.ipynb) 

Lemmatization and Stemming of Words with both Nltk and Spacy - [Lemmatization and Stemming](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/NLP-practise/blob/main/Lemmatization_and_Stemming.ipynb)

POS tags and how it can be used to filter a doc or get info of number of tags - [POS(Part of Speech)](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/NLP-practise/blob/main/POS(Part_of_Speech)_tagging.ipynb)

NER(Named Entity Recognition) and how it can be modified - [NER(Named entity Recognition)](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/NLP-practise/blob/main/NER(Named_Entity_Recognition).ipynb)

Complete pre-processing pipeline using Spacy - [Preprocessing Pipeline](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/NLP-practise/blob/main/Complete_Preprocessing_using_Spacy.ipynb)

Feature Engineering(converting text to numbers):
